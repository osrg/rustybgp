# RustyBGP: BGP implementation in Rust

The mission is to develop a high-performance and safe BGP implementation; an experiment to implement aged and rusty BGP protocol in a modern language. RustyBGP is [much faster](https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/bgp-perf5-1000-internet-neighbors/) than other OSS implementations. One reason of the high performance is that RustyBGP is designed to exploit multicore processors. Here is a CPU usage comparison with FRR 7.5 during processing 32 peers with 800K prefixes each; RustyBGP (left) uses all the cores while FRR uses only few.

RustyBGP supports the gRPC APIs same as GoBGP; your code to manage GoBGP via the APIs should work with RustyBGP. If you need CLI, [GoBGP CLI tool](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/releases/tag/v3.0.0) allows you to manage RustyBGP. RustyBGP also supports the same configuration file format as GoBGP (only toml and yaml for now).

## Get Started

You can easily build RusyBGP on any system that has Docker running. You don't need Rust development environment. You can build the x86_64 statically-linked binary as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/osrg/rustybgp.git
$ cd rustybgp
$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/home/rust/src ekidd/rust-musl-builder cargo build --release
$ ls -lh target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rustybgpd
-rwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 12M May 10 14:52 target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rustybgpd
```

```bash
$ sudo ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rustybgpd -f gobgpd.conf
Hello, RustyBGP (32 cpus)!
```

Then you can manage the daemon on a different terminal with GoBGP's CLI command.

```bash
$ gobgp neighbor
Peer            AS Up/Down State       |#Received  Accepted
198.51.100.2 65002   never Idle        |        0         0
```

If you just want to check out the performance, start the daemon with `--any-peers` option. The daemon accepts any peers without configuration.

```bash
$ sudo ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rustybgpd --as-number 65001 --router-id 203.0.113.1 --any-peers
Hello, RustyBGP (32 cpus)!
```

## Supported Features

Currently, the very basic BGP features are supported; eBGP and iBGP, acstive/passive connection, RPKI, BMP (BGP monitoring protocol), MRT, etc with the following gRPC APIs.
